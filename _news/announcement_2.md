We just pushed the **SuperGen** preprint to arXiv! This project has been in the works with Fanjiang Ye, Boya Zeng, and an amazing multi-institution crew. The central idea is simple: pair sketching-based priors with tiled generation so we can push ultra-high-resolution video synthesis onto commodity clusters.

Key highlights:

- **Sketching + tiling** keeps memory in check while preserving long-range structure.
- **Adaptive scheduling** lets us mix coarse and fine tiles without retraining.
- The system runs on modest clusters while matching the fidelity of heavier pipelines.

If you're curious about efficient video generation—or just want to see pretty samples—check out the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17756v1). I'm always happy to chat about the work or share early benchmarks.
