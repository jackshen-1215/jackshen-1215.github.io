Hi! I'm Jucheng (Jack) Shen, a junior at Rice University majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics.

I'm broadly interested in **efficient machine learning algorithms and systems**. Currently, I'm working on:
- **Diffusion large language models** – developing test-time scaling approaches and dynamic thresholding methods to accelerate inference
- **Multi-modal diffusion video generation** – building training-free systems for ultra-high-resolution video generation

Research
======
I'm fortunate to work with researchers at **The University of Texas at Austin** on diffusion language models, where I've developed algorithms that achieve up to 50% speedup in decoding. I also collaborate with **Prof. Yuke Wang's group at Rice University** on SuperGen, an efficient ultra-high-resolution video generation system.

My work has been accepted to the **NeurIPS 2025 Efficient Reasoning Workshop**, and I will be presenting my work there this December at San Diego!
