Hi! I'm Jucheng (Jack) Shen, a junior at Rice University majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics.

I'm broadly interested in **efficient machine learning algorithms and systems**. Currently, I'm working on:
- **Diffusion large language models** – developing test-time scaling approaches and dynamic thresholding methods to accelerate inference
- **Multi-modal diffusion video generation** – building training-free systems for ultra-high-resolution video generation

Research
======
I'm fortunate to work with [Yeonju Ro](https://sites.google.com/view/hey-yeonju) under the supervision of [Prof. Atlas Wang](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/atlas-wang) at **The University of Texas at Austin** on diffusion language models, where I've developed algorithms that achieve up to 50% speedup in decoding while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Building on this work, I'm collaborating with three Intel researchers on training-free approaches to further accelerate inference for diffusion large language models.

I also collaborate with [Fanjiang Ye](https://home.fanjiang.net/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yuke Wang](https://www.wang-yuke.com/) at **Rice University** on SuperGen, an efficient ultra-high-resolution video generation system.

My work has been accepted to the **NeurIPS 2025 Efficient Reasoning Workshop**, and I'll be presenting this December in San Diego. Hope to see you there!
