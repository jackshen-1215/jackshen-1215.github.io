This work introduces a core algorithm that accelerates diffusion language model decoding by up to 50% through dynamic thresholding. The research was conducted as part of an independent project at The University of Texas at Austin, with the full paper accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Efficient Reasoning Workshop.
