SuperGen is a training-free ultra-high-resolution (2-4K) video generation system. This research, conducted at Rice University with Prof. Yuke Wang's group, proposes core algorithmic ideas and achieves significant speedups: up to 1.19x at 2K and 1.36x at 4K via region-aware caching, with further improvements using 4 GPUs (1.97x speedup at 2K and 1.46x at 4K).
